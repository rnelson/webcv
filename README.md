# CV

!![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rnelson/webcv)

A simple React application to display my résumé. Everything is powered by `/src/assets/cv.json`.

## Usage

After cloning the repo and updating `cv.json`, simply run `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

Note that [the URL for FontAwesome](https://github.com/rnelson/webcv/blob/main/index.html#L11) is only usable on my domains, so you will need to swap that or import a copy of the free FA.
